================

This package consists of several additional Internet Express 
components.  See the list of components below.  The TReconcilePageProducer
component is particularly usefull.

Examples using many of these components can be found in the inetxcenter demo
application.

Component Installation:

       then open ..\demos\Midas\InternetExpress\InetCustom\DclInetXCustom.dpk

       InetXCustom.dcp to open the InetXCustom.dpk package.  Click the
       'Compile' button to compile InetXCustom.dcp.  When compiled, close the
       InexXCustom package.

       available on the InternetExpress tab of the component palette.
       All of the other components are added to a TMidasPageProducer component
       using the Object TreeView or the TMidasPageProducer component editor.
       
Image components
================

The TImg* components use the <IMG> element to display a .gif file.  You will
need to copy the .gif files to your web server's virtual directory so that
they can be downloaded.  If you would like the .gif files to display properly at
design time, add the following registry string:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\
delphi\7.0\Property Editors\WebPage Editor\BlankPage = 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\blank.htm'

Substitute c:\inetpub\wwwroot with the directory where the .gif files are located.
You will also need to create a file called blank.htm in this directory.  This
file should be empty.
  
The file specified by this registry key will be used to initialize the
WebBrowser control embedded within the TMidasPageProducer property editor. 

You may also specify a URL instead of a file path.  For example,
BlankPage = http://localhost/blank.htm.   A URL must be used if you set the
TImgDataNavigator.ImagePathURL to the name of a virtual directory.  For example,
TImgDataNavigator.ImagePathURL = '/images/';
