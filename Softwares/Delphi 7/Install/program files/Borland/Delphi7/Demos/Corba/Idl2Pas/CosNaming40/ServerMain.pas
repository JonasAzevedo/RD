                COSNaming Server Demo for VisiBroker 4 for Delphi

  The naming service changed significantly from VisiBroker 3.3 to VisiBroker 4.
  Now it is a java application that must be started with a command line that
  tells the Name Service which port to use for communications.  In addition,
  all clients and servers must use the same command line parameter as well.  The
  command line is used to "bootstrap" the Orb so that it knows which port to
  use for the Name Service.

  The naming service must be started before either the client or server.  Once
  the Name Service is up and running in a command window, its IOR will be
  displayed in the window.  Then the server and the client can be started (in
  that order).  Sample batch files have been provided with this example to
  show how to start each application.

  In a DOS window, run StartNS.bat first.  This brings up the Naming Service.
  Then run StartServer.bat.  After the server is up and running, run
  StartClient.bat
