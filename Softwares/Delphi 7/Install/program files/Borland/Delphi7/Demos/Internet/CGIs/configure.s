# ScriptName: configure.s 
#
# Objective:
#	     Crate a apache.conf file that contains the directives that need 
#	     to be added to httpd.conf. This is based upon the current location
#	     of the CGIs directory, so it is essential that this script and the 
# 	     CGIs directory is in the needed location prior to running the script.
