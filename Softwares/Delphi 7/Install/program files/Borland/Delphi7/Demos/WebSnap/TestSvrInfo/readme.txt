WebSnap Demos
TestSvrInfo directory

This example web application provides the functionality of serverinfo.exe using server side
script and adapters. (Serverinfo.exe is the application that is used with the Web App
Debugger to display and start registered Web App Debugger executables).

This demo demonstrates a custom Adapter component as well as mixing server side and
client side JavaScript.

It also demonstrates how to store HTML template files as resources so that there is only
a single deployment file.
