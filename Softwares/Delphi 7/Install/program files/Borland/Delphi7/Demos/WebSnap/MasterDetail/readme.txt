MasterDetail directory

This example demonstrates how to use TDataSetAdapter components to view and edit master
detail relationships.  A record from the BDE orders table along with associated detail items
are displayed on a single HTML form.  Edit, Browse, and Cancel buttons are used to 
change the DataSetAdapter mode.  The Apply button submits changes to the master and
details in a single HTTP request.
