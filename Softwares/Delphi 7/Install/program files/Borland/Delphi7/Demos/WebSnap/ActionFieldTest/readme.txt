WebSnap Demos
ActionFieldTest directory

This example uses components from the demos\websnap\actionfield\dclactionfield.dpk 
package to create a grid with a checkbox column.  Check one or more rows
and choose apply updates to delete the checked rows.

You will need to build actionfield\dclactionfield.dpk and install Projects\bpl\dclactionfield.bpl 
before opening this application.
