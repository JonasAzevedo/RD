PostSOAP
========

The PostSOAP utility allows you to send XML to a SOAP Service and view
the response. It utilizes the THTTPReqResp component used by THTTPRIO for
HTTP communication.

The sample can save and load .SOP files that contain information about the
Service's SOAP endpoint (i.e. URL), it's SOAPAction and the packet for
a particular request.

A sample .SOP file is included. It sends a string to the Delphi
Interoperability WebService located at http://soap-server.borland.com
