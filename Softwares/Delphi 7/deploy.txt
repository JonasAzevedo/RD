lications, components, or libraries. This file is provided
pursuant to the Borland License Terms and provides

1. General Application Deployment
===========================================================
Delphi 7 applications do not require an interpreter. In 
general, all you have to provide is your .EXE file
and any DLLs or BPLs that it calls. For simple applications
you can distribute a standalone .EXE file. CLX applications
are an exception to this as you must always redistribute
qtintf70.dll for VisualCLX applications. 
If you have used runtime packages with your application, 
be sure to include all required BPLs with your
distribution.

2. Components and Packages
===========================================================
2.1 Distributing Custom Packages
--------------------------------
If you distribute Delphi 7 packages to other developers, be
sure to supply both .DCP and .BPL files. You will probably
also want to include .DCU files as well as documentation.
Package Collection (.DPC) files, created with the Package
Collection Editor, offer a convenient way to distribute all
the files associated with a package or group of packages.

2.2 Borland Runtime Packages
----------------------------
In accordance with the General Terms That Apply to Compiled
Programs and Redistributables, you may redistribute
Borland-supplied runtime packages only for the purpose of
executing Works created with Delphi. You may not modify 
these packages in any way. By default the
redistributable runtime packages are installed in the
system-files directory of the computer (commonly this is
the \windows\system on Windows98, \WINNT\System32 on
Windows 2000 and Windows XP computers).

Although this software may include packages other than
those listed below, only the packages identified below
as redistributable may be redistributed by you.

You may NOT redeploy Borland-supplied design-time-only
packages. You may not recompile or redistribute any
Borland-supplied components or libraries for use by other
developers.

Packages that you develop may not have the same names as
Borland-supplied packages. If you distribute component
libraries or other packages, it is recommended that you
avoid using the default DCLUSR package name, since this
will cause naming conflicts with other developers.

3. The Borland Database Engine (BDE)
===========================================================
Delphi 7 applications that use the Borland Database Engine
(BDE) for database access require that you distribute
the BDE with the application.

In accordance with the Additional License Terms for BDE,
you may distribute the BDE files with your application
using a Borland-certified Redistributable Install program
such as InstallShield Express or another compliant install
program. You may redistribute only those BDE files selected
by the Borland-certified installation program.

Additionally, Borland supplies a BDE merge module that is an
approved mechanism for deploying BDE.  This module may be used
with any Windows Installer (MSI) development tool (such as
InstallShield for Windows Installer, Wise for Windows
Installer and others).  The merge module includes the base
BDE and SQL Links appropriate to the version of Delphi
purchased.

See the BDE Links deployment notes in the file
BDEDEPLOY.TXT (found in the BDE directory) for specific
information regarding deploying the BDE with database
applications created in Delphi.


4. ActiveX Controls (OCXs)
===========================================================
Delphi includes ActiveX Controls (OCXs) for use in your
applications:

  o Chart FX, copyright SoftwareFX Inc.
  o VisualSpeller Control, copyright Visual Components,
    Inc.
  o Formula One (spreadsheet), copyright Visual Components,
    Inc.
  o First Impression (VtChart), copyright Visual
    Components, Inc.

The version of each of these OCXs shipped with Delphi may
be redistributed in custom Delphi applications. Such
redistribution is subject to the General Terms That Apply
to Compiled Programs and Redistributables.


5. Sample Images
===========================================================
Delphi includes a library of redistributable bitmap images
normally installed in the subdirectory:

  \Program Files\Common Files\Borland Shared\Images

Delphi also includes a database EVENTS.DB with licensed
images from PhotoDisc. The images in this database are
copyright PhotoDisc, Inc. 1995 and may not be
redistributed.


6. WebSnap Application Deployment
===========================================================
If you created your application as a Web App Debugger
executable, you will first have to convert it to an
ISAPI DLL, CGI executable, or Apache Shared Module. To
deploy your DLL or EXE to a web server, you will have to
place your application in a directory that has executable
rights. With Internet Information Services (IIS) this is
typically C:\Inetpub\Scripts. For each WebModule in your
application, you must copy the associated HTML file to the
same directory as your EXE/DLL. By default, the associated
HTML file is simply the WebModule unit's name with .html
as the extension.
 
WebSnap applications require the Microsoft Active
Scripting Engine in order to work. It is included with
Internet Explorer 5, and is installed by default on Windows
2000 machines. To download the Scripting Engine, visit:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/


7. SQL Links deployment (Enterprise edition only)
===========================================================
7.1 SQL Links redistributable files
------------------------------------
See the BDE/SQL Links deployment notes in the file
BDEDEPLOY.TXT (found in the BDE directory) for specific
information regarding redeploying the SQL Links software.
(SQL Links is available only with the Delphi 7 Enterprise
edition.)

7.2 InterBase
--------------
See the BDE/SQL Links deployment notes in the file
BDEDEPLOY.TXT (found in the BDE directory) for specific
information regarding redeploying the SQL Links software
for InterBase.


8. JPEG compression software
===========================================================
The Delphi CD includes software for JPEG image compression
and decompression. This software and its source code are
distributed by the Independent JPEG Group and copyrighted
by Thomas G. Lane. For conditions of distribution and use,
see the README file that accompanies the software.


9. Data compression library (zlib)
===========================================================
The Delphi CD includes zlib data compression software. This
software and its source code are copyrighted by Mark Adler
and others and may be used and distributed subject to the
conditions specified in the file zlib.h.


10. Windows Common Controls
===========================================================
The Windows common controls are provided in a Microsoft-approved
installation file, 50comupd.exe. This file contains the
common controls library, comctl32.dll. The only approved
method for updating end-user computers is by the use of
50comupd.exe. This file can be redistributed with applications
built using Delphi. No other method is permitted.

11. Delphi Utilities
===========================================================
The utility programs included with Delphi 7 may NOT be
redistributed with deployed applications. These utility
programs include, but are not limited to:
