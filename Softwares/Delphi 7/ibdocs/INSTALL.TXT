WELCOME TO INTERBASE 6.5
---------------------------------------

Installation notes and issues for InterBase 6.5
for Windows XP/2000/NT and Windows 98/ME.

______________________
PREPARING TO INSTALL

1. SAVING OLDER DATABASES
InterBase 6.5 uses a new On-Disk Structure (ODS),
ODS 10. Databases created with InterBase 4.0 
used ODS 8.0 and InterBase 5 used ODS 9. To 
take advantage of new Version 6.5 features, you 
must use gbak to back up any databases that 
you intend to use with Version 6.5. Version 3 
databases must be backed up using the Version
3 gbak. Version 4 databases can be backed up 
using Version 4 gbak or Version 5 gbak.  Once 
a database has been backed up, you need to 
restore them With your new version 6.5 and they
will be converted to ODS 10. 
Please Note: ODS 10 databases cannot be 
converted back to earlier versions of the ODS.


2.  OLDER VERSIONS OF INTERBASE
It is recommended that you uninstall any
previous versions of InterBase prior to
InterBase 6.5 that are present on the server 
where you are installing new InterBase  
software. With this software, as with any 
software, it is recommended to remove any 
field test versions prior to installing. 
If InterBase 4.1 or earlier is present on 
your database server, you *must* uninstall 
it before proceeding with the Version 6.5 
install.


3.  GDS32.DLL
There must be one and only one copy of
gds32.dll on the server where InterBase 6.5
is running. If gds32.dll exists on the
server because you have previously
installed Borland Database Engine as part
of Delphi, C++Builder, or another Borland
product, or because InterBase 4.1 or earlier
was installed on the server, you must
remove the older gds32.dll file.

4.  For Windows 2000 users

If you have a previous version of InterBase on you computer,
you will need to follow these steps before you install:

1.  Go to Services and shut down InterBase Guardian and Server
2.  Close the Services application.
3.  Go to Control Panel and Launch "Add-Remove Programs"
4.  Remove InterBase.
5.  Delete the full InterBase directory.
6.  Delete gds32.dll from c:\winnt\system32
7.  Now install InterBase.
