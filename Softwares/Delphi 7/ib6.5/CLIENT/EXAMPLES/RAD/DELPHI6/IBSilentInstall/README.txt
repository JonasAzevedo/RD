==============================
Name:
 IBInstallConfig

Description:

 This program is a simple utility that will generate a config file that is
used by IBSilen.exe.  It prompts users with the different Interbase 6.0
install options which are written to a text file.

 Choosing which Interbase Install Options should be researched in the
Interbase 6.0 Documentation.  For example choosing the IB_ODBC_CLIENT option,
which is listed in IBInstall.pas, is obsolete and doesn't make any sense.
(Easysoft has its own installation)

Name:
 IBSilent

Usage:
 IBSilent [-v]

Description:
  This program uses the file ib_silent.cfg which is generated by IBInstallConfig or manually.
The file contains the options desired for an Interbase 6.0 install and the desired 
installation directory. 

The if the full Interbase installation is to be done then one should use the options
that constitute a full install. (See documentation for isc_install_set_option)

ib_silent requires an installation path which is specified with a [INPATH] tag (case sensitive). 
The following line should contain the complete path for the install... in future I
plan to generalize the install so that the install path could be passed in as a parameter.
It is suitable now as is for demo purposes.

Requires:
 ib_silent.cfg
 ibinstall.dll
   - Dependant on the type of installation, certain files will be required from the
     Interbase 6.0 installation CD for the install.  The files should be in hierarchical 
     order similar to that of the CD. 
	
 When the program is run the exe should placed at the top of the install hierarch.  ibinstall.dll
 should also be placed in the same directory as the exe.
