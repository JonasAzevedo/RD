PVCS Installation Instructions
===========================================================

Use the following instructions to create a Workgroups menu 
and enable Delphi 5 access to an installed copy of the 
PVCS version control system.

Prerequisite:
   InterSolv's PVCS application must be installed and
   its location included on your system path.
   
Instructions for enabling PVCS:

1. Close Delphi.

2. Copy the following file from your Delphi 5 CD to any 
   folder on your local drive:
   
   \Info\Workgroups\PVCS.REG

3. Use Notepad (or another text editor) to open the copied 
   PVCS.REG file on your local drive.
   
4. Edit the paths to match the directory into which you
   installed Delphi 5. If, for example, you installed
   Delphi to D:\delphi, you would change the three path 
   strings in the .REG file from,
   
   REGEDIT4
   
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\Delphi\5.0\Version Control]
   "VCSManager"="C:\\Program Files\\Borland\\Delphi5\\Bin\\STDVCS32.DLL"
   "PublicPrjDir"="C:\\Program Files\\Borland\\Delphi5\\PVCS"
   "PrivatePrjDir"="C:\\Program Files\\Borland\\Delphi5\\PVCS"

   to,
   
   REGEDIT4
      
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\Delphi\5.0\Version Control]
   "VCSManager"="D:\\Delphi\\Bin\\STDVCS32.DLL"
   "PublicPrjDir"="D:\\Delphi\\PVCS"
   "PrivatePrjDir"="D:\\Delphi\\PVCS"

5. Save the file.

6. Execute PVCS.REG by double-clicking the file name in 
   Windows Explorer (or by choosing it and selecting 
   "Merge" from the right-click popup menu).

7. Copy the following files from your Delphi 5 CD to your 
   Delphi installation directory's \Bin folder:

   \Info\Workgroups\STDVCS32.DLL
   \Info\Workgroups\CFOLDER.DLL
   \Info\Workgroups\DFOLDER.DLL

8. Restart Delphi. The WorkGroups menu should now be 
   available and functional.
   
To integrate the supplied PVCS Help files into your
Delphi 5 Help system:

1. Copy the following files from your Delphi 5 CD to your 
   Delphi installation directory's \Help folder:
   
   \Info\Workgroups\PVCS.HLP   
   \Info\Workgroups\PVCS.CNT
   
2. Choose Customize from the Delphi Help menu to start
   Openhelp.

3. Add PVCS to the Contents and Index lists. (If you 
   encounter difficulties with this step, see Openhelp's 
   online Help file for details on how to add entries to 
   and remove entries from an Openhelp project.)
