===========================================================
Note: The FIF libraries that were supplied in the
\INFO\EXTRAS folder in previous versions of Delphi are no
longer available due to discontinued development and
support by the vendor, Iterated Systems.
===========================================================

The following is a description of the add-in units 
available in the \INFO\EXTRAS directory on your Delphi CD.

\INFO\EXTRAS\COMCTL
-----------------------------------------------------------
This includes the comctl32.dll from Internet Explorer 
version 5.0. This is supplied for compatibility reasons.

\INFO\EXTRAS\JPEG
-----------------------------------------------------------
   This directory includes the Delphi unit files
   JConsts.pas and JPeg.pas, which were used to generate
   the .DCU files installed with Delphi.  The JPeg unit
   (and the .DCUs installed with Delphi) defines a graphic
   class (TJPEGImage) and its helper object (TJPEGData).
   The .DCUs installed with Delphi are completely self-
   sufficient -- you do not need any of the files in the
   INFO\EXTRAS\JPEG directory to use these.  However, if
   you wish to read or alter the JPEG source, you may edit
   the unit files in the JPEG directory. If you recompile
   the units in the INFO\EXTRAS\JPEG directory, you must
   link in the object files for the Independent JPEG
   group's (IPG) implementation of the JPEG compression/
   decompression standard. The OBJ files in this JPEG
   library are included in the OBJ subdirectory. If you
   wish to view the source files for those OBJ files, you
   can look in the SRC directory. The SRC directory also
   includes a readme file that provides more information,
   including distribution information.
   
\INFO\EXTRAS\REGCLEANUTILITY
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is the source to the D7REGCLEAN.EXE utility found in 
the \bin directory. This tool will clean up user settings in 
the registry.


\INFO\EXTRAS\REGFLIP
-----------------------------------------------------------
RegFlip is a utility that will allow you to add, remove, and
edit settings for Just In Time Debuggers in the Windows 
registry.

\INFO\EXTRAS\SENDKEYS
-----------------------------------------------------------
  This unit includes two functions provided by Ken
  Henderson that simulate popular Visual Basic routines:
  Sendkeys and AppActivate. SendKeys can send only key-
  strokes that are available directly from the keyboard. It
  does not send so-called "dead keys" -- special key
  combinations used in some languages.
  

\INFO\EXTRAS\TRANSLATION MGR
-----------------------------------------------------------
Information on how to install the External Translation 
Manager on a translator's machine, and how to send and 
receive Delphi projects for translation.

\INFO\EXTRAS\ZLIB
-----------------------------------------------------------
   This directory includes the Delphi ZLIB unit file, which
   implements utilities for compressing and decompressing
   information using the freely distributable library
   written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.  This unit
   provides two stream objects, TCompressionStream and
   TDecompressionStream, that can be used to compress
   information as it is written or decompress information
   as it is read. It also includes the global CompressBuf
   and DecompressBuf procedures to compress and decompress
   information using buffers. To use the ZLIB unit, you
   must link the OBJ files in the OBJ directory to your
   Delphi application. The C source for these .OBJ files is
   included in the SRC directory, along with a readme file
   that provides more information about the library and a
   disclaimer by the authors.
