REGARDING DISTRIBUTION OF COMCTL32.DLL: 

*****************************************************************************
** YOU MAY NOT REDISTRIBUTE THE COMCTL32.DLL CONTROL AS A STANDALONE FILE. **
*****************************************************************************

Microsoft does NOT allow the separate redistribution of COMCTL32.DLL at this
time, and you will NOT be provided with written permission. However, the 
following alternatives are available to you and we hope at least one of them
will meet your business needs: 

1. You may distribute Internet Explorer, which includes COMCTL32.DLL.  Under 
   your End User License Agreement (EULA) for Microsoft Internet Explorer,
   you may have redistribution rights for COMCTL32.DLL as a component of and
   under the terms of your license for Internet Explorer in its entirety.

   This license does NOT enable you to redistribute the DLL separately under
   the Internet Explorer EULA. Please review the EULA, redistribution
   agreement, and other information regarding the terms of use of Internet
   Explorer located at
      http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ 
   and
      http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ieak/

   Should you have questions regarding the licensing of Internet Explorer,
   please contact ieak@microsoft.com.

2. You may provide instructions to your customers to visit 
      http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp 
   where they may download an utility that will install COMCTL32.DLL.  Your
   customers should be given instructions to choose the latest version number 
   (currently 50comupd.exe - which includes COMCTL32.DLL version number
   5.80.2614.3600).

   This installation utility is an .EXE file, which is a self-extracting
   archive.  Once downloaded, the self-extracting archive can then be used by
   the customer to install COMCTL32.DLL onto their system.

   NOTE: Older versions of this component can be found on
      ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles
   These files are available for testing purposes only; your customers should 
   be encouraged to install the latest version, and discouraged from
   installing older versions.

   The self-extracting archive and the corresponding version numbers of the
   controls are as follows:

   COMCTL32.DLL version 4.70 (which shipped with Internet Explorer 3.0)
      will be installed from COM32UPD.EXE
   COMCTL32.DLL version 4.72 (which shipped with Internet Explorer 4.01) 
      will be installed from 40COMUPD.EXE

   And once again, the latest version can be found on 
      http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp
   as follows:

   COMCTL32.DLL version 5.80 (which shipped with Internet Explorer 5.0)
      will be installed from 50COMUPD.EXE

   You will find more information and further instruction with regard to the
   5.80 COMCTL32.DLL at
      http://msdn.microsoft.com/isapi/msdnlib.idc?theURL=/library/sdkdoc/portals/mainport.htm

3. You may redistribute the self-extracting archives (the .EXE files)
   described above, in their entirety under the terms of the license 
   agreements contained in the self-extracting archives. Please review the
   End User License Agreements (EULAs) contained in the 50COMUPD.EXE,
   40COMUPD.EXE, and COM32UPD.EXE to determine your rights to redistribute
   the self-extracting archives.  A copy of this EULA is available for
   download on
      http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp.

   *****************************************************************
   ** YOU MAY NOT REDISTRIBUTE COMCTL32.DLL AS A STANDALONE FILE. **
   *****************************************************************
   
   You may only redistribute the self-extracting archives (the .EXE files),
   which in turn will install COMCTL32.DLL.  This is the only way to ensure 
   that installation happens correctly on all supported languages and 
   versions of Microsoft Windows.

   NOTE: If you run the self-extracting archives in normal mode (just by 
   running the .EXE), the EULA is displayed in a dialog window. You may
   distribute this component in quiet mode so long as you distribute your own 
   software product containing the self-extracting archive pursuant to an 
   End-User License Agreement with terms no less protective than those 
   contained in the applicable OS Product EULA. Your End-User License
   Agreement may be "break-the-seal", "click-wrap" or signed. Quiet mode is 
   enabled with the /q switch e.g. "50comupd.exe /q".
   
   Again, the self-extracting archive for the latest version is available at
      http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp
