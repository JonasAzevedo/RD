ABOUT THE INSTALLER

This product uses the Microsoft Installer (MSI) 2.0
service to perform the installation. Among the more
significant changes are:

* In many cases, rebooting after installation is no
  longer necessary. The Borland Debugger kernel and
  other Borland components are automatically registered
  during installation. However, the installer may
  update some Windows system components, which will
  require you to reboot at the end of the installation.
  In addition, if you are installing on Windows 95/98
  or Windows Me, you may wish to reboot to have your
  PATH environment updated.

* An installation maintenance mode is available by
  simply rerunning the installation. The maintenance
  dialog lets you add or remove features, repair the
  installation, or remove the product. Choosing
  "Modify" lets you install features that you did not
  previously install, or remove features that you no
  longer use. Choosing "Repair" causes the installer to
  search for and reinstall any files that are missing
  or damaged. "Remove" uninstalls the product.

* On Windows 2000 and higher (including Windows XP),
  the Microsoft Installer service provides an auto-
  repair feature that constantly tries to detect and
  repair damaged applications. One of the ways that it
  does this is by monitoring the installed directory
  structure of an application. If you delete or rename
  any of the directories installed by Delphi 7, the
  Microsoft Installer will detect this and will,
  without warning, attempt to restore the missing
  directories. To prevent the auto-repair function from
  being unintentionally invoked, you should not
  manually delete or rename any of the installed Delphi
  7 directories. To add or remove features, always use
  the installer application.

Setup will install MDAC 2.7 if it fails to detect MDAC
2.7 or later on your machine. You might get a reboot
prompt at the end of installation if MDAC 2.7 was
installed by the Setup program.

=======================================================
PRODUCT COEXISTENCE ISSUES

Using the Web App Debugger in Delphi 6 (or) C++Builder 6
after uninstalling Delphi 7
-------------------------------------------------------

If you install Delphi 7 on a machine on which either
Delphi 6 or C++Builder 6 is installed, then uninstall
Delphi 7, the Web App Debugger will no longer work as
expected.

Solution: After uninstalling Delphi 7, you can
reregister the WebApp Debugger by running the following
from your Delphi6\Bin (or) CBuilder6\Bin directory:

1.   Run ServerInfo for the Web App Debugger:
     serverinfo

2.   Use the tregsvr utility to reregister the debugger
     library: tregsvr weblib.tlb


=======================================================
INSTALLING FOR MULTIPLE USERS [WINNT/2000/XP ONLY]

[Note: This section applies only to installations on
Windows NT, 2000, and later Windows operating systems,
including XP. It does not apply to installations on
Windows 95, 98, or Me systems.]

The procedure for installing and uninstalling Delphi 7
for multiple users on Windows NT and Windows 2000
systems has changed.

The new installation procedure no longer requires each
user to install Delphi 7 separately. The product is
installed only once, by any user with Administrator
privileges, and is immediately available to all users
of the same machine. It is also available to any new
users you may add later.

In releases prior to Delphi 6 or C++Builder 6, an
Administrator installed the product, and all other
users of the same machine who needed to use product had
to install it separately using the "Registry Only"
option.

The new uninstallation procedure has also changed. The
Administrator who initially installed the product must
first uninstall it (through the Control Panel's
Add/Remove Programs applet); after that, all other
users of the product must log in and run the provided
D7RegClean.exe utility in order to remove user-specific
data from the Windows registry. (Note: D7RegClean.exe
is installed to your \Bin directory and is also
available on your CD in the \Info\Extras folder.)



Cautions
--------

* Some utilities, such as the Image Editor, the Package
  Collection Editor, Database Desktop, and the
  XMLMapper, will not work correctly until the Delphi 7
  IDE is run at least once. This is because the IDE
  copies a set of global registry entries from
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to the user's registry space. In
  the past, the installation program performed this
  task.

* If you perform a partial install, then add other
  components later, the new components will not
  automatically appear in the IDE. To make the new
  packages appear, you can manually add them to the IDE
  using the Install Packages dialog (Component menu).

=======================================================
GENERAL INSTALLATION NOTES

The following items describe known issues, behavior,
and functionality that can affect installation of this
product. For other installation issues, including how
to remove the product, see the INSTALL document at the
root of your CD.

Minimum system requirements
---------------------------

* Intel Pentium 166 MHz or higher (P2 400 MHz
  recommended)
* Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, and XP
* 256 Mb
* Approximate hard disk space required for a full
  install: 475 Mb (Enterprise edition)
* CD-ROM drive
* VGA or higher resolution monitor
* Mouse or other pointing device


Back up your BDE configuration
------------------------------

This product includes Borland Database Engine (BDE).
Unless you specify other than the default
setup directories during installation, Delphi 7 will
overwrite your existing 32-bit BDE and SQL Links
installations, so it is strongly recommended that you
back up all current BDE configuration files before
installing this release.

Installation directory
----------------------

By default, this release installs into the directory

 \Program Files\Borland\Delphi7

Product release notes and most other documentation
assumes these defaults.

WARNING:
    Do not install Delphi 7 in a directory that
    contains an older version of Delphi. Always install
    a new version of Delphi in a new directory.
    Different versions of Delphi can coexist on the
    same system, but each version must be installed in
    its own directory.

If you've installed this product before
---------------------------------------

You can install to the same machine (though to a
different location) as another version of the product.
If you want to install to the same directory as an
existing version, uninstall the existing version first.
In either case, you should back up your IDAPI.CFG file
(if one is present) and any other important data,
including existing projects that you intend to use with
this version.

Performing a Custom installation
--------------------------------

To conserve disk space, you can perform a custom
installation, selecting only the options you require.
To do so, select the Custom radio button in the Setup
Type dialog during installation. Disk space required
for the total custom installation and individual
options is displayed as you select or deselect options.


Just-In-Time Debugging
----------------------

If the installer detects that another application is
registered as your Just-In-Time debugger, you will be
asked if you want to change this setting to use the
Delphi 7 debugger. For proper operation of this
release, you should choose to update this setting.

To preserve your existing AEDebug settings for later
restoration, follow these steps:

1. Run Regedit.
2. Select the AEDebug key
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\
        Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AEDebug\Debugger
3. Choose Registry|Export Registry File.
4. Name and save the file containing the AEDebug key.

To restore the AEDebug settings:

1. Run Regedit.
2. Choose Registry|Import Registry File.
3. Specify the file in which you saved the AEDebug key.

Manually registering the debugger kernel
----------------------------------------

The new installer does not, in most cases, require you
to reboot after installation. The Borland Debugger
Kernel is automatically registered by the new
installer. If, however, you receive "BORdbk70 not
registered" errors when running the program, then you
will need to manually register the debugger.

To manually register the debugger, open a command
window, cd to the Debugger Kernel location (default

c:\program files\common files\borland
 \shared\debugger\bordbk70.dll)

and run the Microsoft Register Server utility with the
following command:

regsvr32 bordbk70.dll

Note:
 If REGSVR32 is not on your path, switch to your
 Windows\System directory and run the utility with  a
 full path specification to the Debugger Kernel file.


Installer may require additional temporary space
------------------------------------------------

If the drive containing the folder specified in your
TEMP environment variable is low on space, the Installer
may halt with an error message noting the shortage. If
this occurs, you'll need to assign your TEMP variable to
a folder on a drive with more disk space, then rerun
the installation.


=======================================================
KNOWN INSTALLATION ISSUES


JRE, InterBase paths require manual entry
-----------------------------------------

Neither the VisiBroker 4 nor Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) installers set your PATH or CLASSPATH
specifications to point to the JRE installation
location. Unless you manually set these environment
variables, programs requiring the JRE (including all
VisiBroker programs except the OSAgent and the console,
which uses a batch file) will not run.  The InterBase
Administration components IBInstall and IBUninstall
will not work correctly unless you manually add the
<InterBase> location (default C:\Program
Files\Borland\InterBase) to your PATH variable.


Installer may misreport disk space requirements
on Windows 95/98/ME
-----------------------------------------------

On Windows 95, 98, and Me systems, the Microsoft
Windows Installer may misreport the amount of disk
space required by Delphi 7. The Installer may report
that it needs more than 2GB of disk space. Delphi 7
does not require this much space. To work around this
issue, exit the Installer and restart the installation.


=======================================================
REGISTERING THIS PRODUCT

TRIAL EDITION

To activate this product, you must obtain an activation
file. You must obtain from the Borland Web site:

  http://www.borland.com/products/downloads

The Software License for Trial products will be emailed to
you upon submission of the form on that site. Your
evaluation period begins on the day you submit your request
for an authorization key.


PROFESSIONAL AND ENTERPRISE EDITIONS

To activate this product, you must obtain a Serial Number
and Authorization Key.

The Serial Number and Authorization Key are supplied with
your CD.

You must also register the product after activation.

The Registration dialog, which appears on first use
after activation, offers three registration methods:
Online (direct registration through a secure connection),
by telephone, or through a Web form.

Each of the Registration options is driven by wizards,
with Help provided where necessary.

NOTE: Online activation and registration requires an active
      Internet connection. The process uses port 443 for
      the transaction;  if there is a problem using that
      port, an attempt is made through port 8080. If your
      machine is protected by a firewall and the process
      fails, you must either contact your system
      administrator to request that the ports noted above
      be made available, or use an alternate registration
      method, such as telephone or Web registration. Online
      registration also requires that all users of this
      copy of the software use the same software
      registration account when registering.

REGISTRATION DEFERRAL

All editions require registration.  Registration for
the Professional and Enterprise editions may be
deferred.  The Trial edition will NOT run without a
valid Software License.  The software license contains
the registration information.

If you try to run the Trial edition without a valid
Software License, you will be directed where to go to
obtain one.


If you choose to defer registration, you can register
later by running the registration program D7Reg.exe
in the bin directory of your installation, or in the
Delphi 7 program group in your start menu.


=======================================================
UNINSTALLING THIS PRODUCT


To uninstall this release from your computer, you can
perform either the following:

*  Open the Control Panel and double-click the
   Add/Remove Programs icon. Select Borland Delphi 7
   from the list and click the Add/Remove button.
   Follow the instructions.


Notes:

* During installation you're asked if you want to save
  a copy of the installation database to your hard disk
  drive. Doing so will allow you to uninstall without
  inserting the product CD. However, if the local copy
  of the installation database becomes damaged or is
  erased, the CD may be required to uninstall the
  product. The installation database ("Borland Delphi
  7.msi") can be found in the Install directory on your
  CD.

* Delphi 7 and other dbExpress-based applications use
  the registry key

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\DBExpress

  to locate the database configuration files
  (dbxconnections.ini and dbxdrivers.ini).

  When uninstalling Delphi 7, you are asked if you want
  to remove the dbExpress registry keys. If you know
  that you are not using any other dbExpress-based
  applications, you can answer Yes. If other dbExpress
  applications exists on your computer, you should
  answer No.

  If you do not delete the dbExpress registry entries
  and you later reinstall Delphi 7 to a different
  location, you will need to manually delete this
  registry key for dbExpress to recognize your new
  configuration file location.
